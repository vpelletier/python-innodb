Python ctypes-based wrapper for libinnodb.

Severe "works for me" state.
Deeply ugly Makefile.
Almost not tested.
API *will* change when I get a good idea of how things work in libinnodb.
You've been warned.

Requirements
- python (tested with 2.6) with ctypes: http://www.python.org
- libinnodb (tested with 1.0.6.6750, protocol version 3.0.0):
  http://www.innodb.com/wp/2009/06/24/embedded-innodb-1-0-3-5325-released/
  (warning: site seems severly out of date)
- python-enum: https://github.com/vpelletier/python-enum

Tested on linux x86_64, debian sid.
